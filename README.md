# House-Price-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression   
This dataset of 2,000 residential properties is used to predict the sale price of houses using Linear Regression in Python. 
It includes 10 key features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, year built, location, and condition. EDA and 
preprocessing were performed, including outlier detection, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling. A sale price prediction 
model was designed and trained on the cleaned data, achieving accurate results in estimating property prices. The project 
uses key Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization,
and model building.
